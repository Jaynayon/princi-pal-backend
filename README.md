# Getting Started
**PrinciPal: Streamlined Public School Document Management System**.\
This project is made in fulfillment with our Capstone subject in IT332 S.Y. 2023-2024.\
The system aims to provide school admins an efficient, simplistic, and all-in-one management and automation of report/s.

## Prerequisites
Ensure that **node_modules** is installed by initially running **`npm install`**.\
No need to run `npm init -y` as the **package.json** file is already configured.

By default, the **.env** file is ignored. Since it is necessary, you must create your own **.env** file in the root directory.\
As a convention, let's use `DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost/db_princi_pal` for configuring our local development environment.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run devStart`

Runs the server in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)/{collections} to view it in your browser.

You may configure or run tests on the `routes.rest` file.
